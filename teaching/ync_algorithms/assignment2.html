      <h3>1. Traveling Salesman Problem using a Greedy Algorithm</h3>
      <p>
      "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of
      cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each
      city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" is a problem
      known as the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Your task is to write a
      program using python to solve the TSP  by
      utilizing a greedy algorithm. Your 
      input is an array, where each cell contains a record/structure
      of a pair of cities and their distance. Your output are an array
      or list  containing the shortest path and its total
      distance. In your submission, write briefly why greedy
      algorithms are only suboptimal.
      </p>
      
      <br>
      <h3>2. Maximum Flow using Linear Programming</h3>      <p>
	Write a program in python to solve the maximum flow problem using
	linear programming. Your input is an array where each cell
	contains the names of two nodes (the first node is the source
	and the second is the destination) and the capacity of their
	edge. The output is an array containing the pairs of nodes
	that when you cut their edges, give the minimum cut cost.
	In your program, you must implement the simplex
	algorithm by yourself. 
      </p>

      <h3>3. Typo Correction using Dynamic Programming</h3>
      <p>
	Automatic typo correction can be normally done by referring to
	a dictionary. However, without a dictionary can we actually
	solve it? The answer is yes, and one of the methods is the HMM
	(Hidden Markov Model).

	<ol>
	  <li> <h4>Hidden Markov Model</h4>
	Mathematically, it is expressed as:
	<center>
	<img src="eq1.jpg" alt="input" height="25" />,
	</center>
	<br>
	where the first term is called the backward inference, and the
	second term is called the forward inference. <i>d_k</i> is the
	observed data at time <i>k</i>, and <i>x_k</i> is a hidden
	variable at time <i>k</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
	The forward inference can be further written as:
	<center>
	<img src="eq2.jpg" alt="input" height="55" />.
	</center>
	<br>
	There are 3 terms on the right side of the equation: the data
	term, the prior and the previous computation of the forward
	inference. 
      </p>
      <p>
	While the backward inference can be written as:
	<center>
	<img src="eq3.jpg" alt="input" height="55" />.
	</center>
      </p>
      <li><h4>Typo Correction Problem</h4>
	<p>
	Given a sequence of observed data or typed letters, how to
	estimate the hidden state sequence, which refers to the
	intended correct sequence of letters. In other words given a
	sequence of letters the beginning to the end: <i>d_1</i>
	to <i>d_N</i>, what are the correct letters of <i>x_1</i>
	to <i>x_N</i>. For instance, the observed letters are "thr",
	where the intended letters or the hidden variables are "the".
	</p>
	<p>
	  To solve this problem using the HMM, we need to learn the
	  parameters of the data term and the prior term. We can learn
	  the data term from wrong sequences and their corresponding
	  correct sequences; and, learn the prior term from the
	  correct sequences.
	</p>
      <li> <h4>Typo Data</h4>
	<p>
	  You can download the typo data
	  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/muzdq7hd9inpm6d/typos10.data?dl=0">here</a>.
	  From  this data, you must use the first 75% for the training purpose,
	  and the remaining 25% for the testing purpose.
	<p>
      </ol>
      Your task is to write a python program to automatically correct
      typos by using an HMM and training it using the provided typo
      data. For the inference in the correction process, you must use
      the Viterbi algorithm, which is dynamic programming in nature.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Submission</h3>
	Submit your work in a ipython notebook format via Canvas by
	the deadline. Each problem above is written in a separated
	individual file.
