      <h3> Homework 5: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h3>

      <br>
      <h4><b>Instructions:</b></h4>
      <p>
	Using either Keras, Caffe or TensorFlow, write  programs in
	Python to solve the following problems using CNNs:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	  CIFAR10  with  architecture of LeNET5
	  <li>
	  CIFAR10  with  architecture of AlexNet
	  <li>
	  CIFAR10  with any architecture that you think is better than AlexNet
	  <li> For each of the above 3 problems, you have to show the graph
	  of the learning process, where the x-axis represents the
	  epoch, and the y-axis represents the overall error. You must
	  also include the code of both the training and testing
	  phases, and evaluation on the performance of the testing
	  phase (in one hundred tests, how many are correct and how
	  many are wrong). 
	</ol> 
      </p>
      <p> Note, you are allowed to use any resources on the internet
      as your reference. However, you are not allowed to just copy
      and paste. You have to write your own code based on your understanding.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Submission:</b></h4>
      <p>
	Submit your python code in an ipython notebook format (and
	your input image) via Canvas
	by the deadline on October 13, at 1pm.
      </p>
