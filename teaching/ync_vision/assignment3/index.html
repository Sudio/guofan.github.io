      <b>Read carefully</b>: Academic integrity must be stricly followed. Copying-and-pasting from other's
      code or froms any sources is not allowed. Software will be used
      to detect any form of source code plagiarism. You must write
      your code in ipython notebook (or ipython jupiter) and write a
      report in a pdf format as instructed below. In the report, you
      must indicate the parts and numbers
      clearly. Your submitted code must be grouped/separated 
      into the same parts as in the instructions. In your submission, you
      must provide us with all necessary libraries.
      The deadlines are strict deadlines
      (point reduction for late submission), so please prepare and plan early and carefully.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Part 1: CIFAR10 Image Classification </b></h4>
      <p>
	<ol>
	Write programs in Python and Keras to classify images in
	<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR10</a>
	using any architecture that gives best performance. Note,
	using AlexNet the accuracy can be up to 70%. In the
	submission, you must include:
	<ol>
	  <li> The error or learning curve, where the x-axis is epoch,
	    and y-axis is the error.
	  <li> The training model (so that I don't need to re-train)
	  <li> The accuracy rate for the test data set.
	</ol>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Part 2: SVHN Localization and Recognition</b></h4>
      <ol>
	Write programs in Python and Keras to locate and recognize
	digits
	in <a href="http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/">SVHN</a>
	dataset.  There are two formats in the dataset, and you must
	use format 1. The Matlab file in the dataset: digitStruct.mat can be read using h5py
	(for example, see <a href="matload.py">here</a>). You are
	allowed to use any architecture. In the submission, you must include:
	<ol>
	  <li> The error or learning curve, where the x-axis is epoch,
	    and y-axis is the error.
	  <li> The training model (so that I don't need to re-train)
	  <li> The accuracy rate for the test data set.
	</ol>
      </ol>

      <br>      
	  <h4><b>Submission:</b></h4>
      <p>
	Submit your <b>codes and report</b> via CANVAS</b>.  The
	report must be in a pdf format.

      </p>
